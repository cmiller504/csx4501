## profile

My name is **Courtney**
I'm the fund/project manager for the [California Conservation Genomics Project](https://www.ccgproject.org/) based at 
UCLA.
I'm from New Orleans, but I've lived in LA for 4 years.
I enjoy spending time outdoors-hiking, surfing, and biking. I'm also a ceramist and avid 
baker. 

## course description
*Introduction to Data ScienceCOM SCI-X 450.1*
This course introduces students to the evolving domain of data science and the food chain 
of knowledge domains involved in its application. Students learn a wide range of 
challenges, questions, and problems that data science helps address in different domains, 
including social sciences, finance, health and fitness, and entertainment. The course 
addresses the key knowledge domains in data science, including data development and 
management, machine learning and natural language processing, statistical analysis, data 
visualization, and inference. The course includes case studies that require students to 
work on real-life data science problems.

## project ideas

###NO.1

I volunteer for an organization called SPY ("Safe Space for Youth"). I would like to work with them to:
* Of the people actively using SPY's services, which are benefiting the most from their programs and why?
* Which services and projects are achieving the most successful outcomes for the individuals SPY serves and why?
* What improvements should be made to SPY's existing Case Management System for collecting data?


###NO.2

Fun project: Surf spot/conditions predictor (compare to Surfline App)

## objectives for the class

My goals for this class are to gain familiarity with the foundational tools in data 
science and start to build a portfolio with projects that address social and environmental
issues.
